<h1>YAG Biography </h1> 
<H3>What is Yag</H3> 
<body> <p> <font size="3" color="blue" face="Calibri">  YAG is a theatre program meant for Firebaugh students. We offer multiple roles and we do multiple plays throughout the year. We try to get students out of their comfort zones. We also take them on field trips to different shows throughout the year. We also offer the opportunity for students to fully direct their own plays. Here at YAG, we work like a family and try to make everyone feel at home. So join us and become part of our theatre family.
